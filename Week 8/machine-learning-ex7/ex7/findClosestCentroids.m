function idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)
%FINDCLOSESTCENTROIDS computes the centroid memberships for every example
%   idx = FINDCLOSESTCENTROIDS (X, centroids) returns the closest centroids
%   in idx for a dataset X where each row is a single example. idx = m x 1 
%   vector of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K])
%

% Set K
K = size(centroids, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
idx = zeros(size(X,1), 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every example, find its closest centroid, and store
%               the index inside idx at the appropriate location.
%               Concretely, idx(i) should contain the index of the centroid
%               closest to example i. Hence, it should be a value in the 
%               range 1..K
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the examples to compute this.

count = size(X,1);

for outer = 1:count,
    min_distance = intmax()
    for inner = 1:K,
       curr_distance = sum( (X(outer,:) - centroids(inner,:) ).^2);
       if curr_distance < min_distance,
          min_distance = curr_distance;
          idx(outer) = inner;
